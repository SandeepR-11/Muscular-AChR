## üìå Overview

This repository hosts the complete dataset, code, structural models, and analysis from the research paper:

**"In Silico Investigation of Snake Venom Three-Finger Toxin and Other Ligand Interactions with Muscular Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors Across Multiple Species: Implications for Neuromuscular Drug Development"**

The study explores the structural and functional dynamics of muscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (MnAChRs) from 10 mammalian species, focusing on their interaction with a snake venom-derived three-finger toxin (3FTX) and several small-molecule ligands using computational approaches.

## üß™ Abstract

Three-finger toxins (3FTXs) derived from snake venom display potent neuromuscular blocking activity by binding strongly to muscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (MnAChRs). This study conducts a comprehensive **in silico** analysis across multiple mammalian species, utilizing **homology modeling**, **molecular docking**, and **molecular dynamics simulations** to evaluate the structural and interactional nuances of MnAChRs. Key findings include species-specific variations in binding affinities and structural adaptations at the receptor‚Äìtoxin interface, offering insights into receptor pharmacodynamics, toxin sensitivity, and the design of targeted therapeutics or antivenoms.

## üîç Key Results

- **Sheep and goat** MnAChRs exhibited the strongest binding to 3FTX (‚àí59.5 kcal/mol).
- Human receptors showed moderate binding (‚àí23.4 kcal/mol), with fewer acidic residues at the binding site.
- 3FTX binding was stabilized by conserved aromatic and polar residues in MnAChRs across species.
- Pharmacological ligands like pancuronium showed high binding affinity (‚àí11.03 kcal/mol), confirming their neuromuscular blocking potency.
- MD simulations confirmed structural stability of the 3FTX‚ÄìMnAChR complex with low RMSD (~1.5 √Ö) and reduced Rg over time.
